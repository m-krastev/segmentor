# Small Bowel Centerline Predictor

This repository has NOT been used, tested, or utilized in any of the experiments. It was only a proof of concept for formulating the task as a next token (3D coordinate) prediction pipeline. 

In theory, even this is WAY too strong of a model for the little data we have of complete centerlines, so don't feel bad about ignoring it.

Some of the more useful stuff one can take away from here are in the utils module.
